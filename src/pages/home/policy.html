information you are asking us to make public. This includes not only the

or collaborated, but also the collaboration collections you make, the people
you support,&nbsp; the people you select as
your buddies, and many other bits of information that result from your use of
the Services. We may use this information to customize the content we show you,
including ads. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide
public for as long as you do not delete it from Spiela, but in the future, we
will have a settings page to make the information more private if you want. Our
Services broadly and instantly broadcast your public information to a wide
range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile
information and public collaborations are immediately delivered to third
parties. When you share information or content like photos, video and collaborations,
